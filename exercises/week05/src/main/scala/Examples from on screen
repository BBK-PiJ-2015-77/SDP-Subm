Simple add def


add def with frozen value

def add(x: Int)(y: Int) = x + y

you can then do, e.g.: add(2)(3)

If you want to freeze the value of something, like 3:

def add3(y: Int) = add(3)(y)

so now 3 is fixed

add3(4)

returns 7

add3(11)

returns 14


If you did something like:

add(3)_

This is called a partial function (or Currying)
