To create a singleton object what do we do?

We make the constructor of the class private
We provide a method that will return the single instance of the class
We either:
a) create the object on loading, or (eager)
b) create the object on demand (lazy)

No amount of casting will get you there

Int 3
new Integer(3)


Design patterns:
